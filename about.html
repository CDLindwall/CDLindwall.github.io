            <p><strong>Who:</strong> My name is Courtney Lindwall. I'm a 21-year-old journalism grad from the University of Florida. 
            <p><strong>What:</strong> This summer I'm interning with The Gainesville Sun, the area's largest daily paper with a weekday circulation of 46,000 and a Sunday circulation of 51,000. Prior, I also worked for the Gainesville-based Tower Publications for a year, which produces three community magazines. Since starting in internships, I've gained confidence as a reporter juggling deadlines and difficult sources. I've written everything from daily crime briefs to profiles about elephant trainers to issue pieces about local politics. As I attempt to do these stories justice, I keep my writing people-driven.</p>
            <p><strong>When:</strong> My relationship with writing started early. As a kid, I was crafting books from construction paper (self-illustrated) and talking about my life as a novelist. But journalism became my focus in high school after working on the school paper and eventually becoming managing editor. My professors and peers at UF have further inspired me to pursue journalism during its next defining era.</p>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Even though everyone seems to have an opinion about the death of traditional journalism, I am looking toward the field's future with optimism. The current generation of professional journalists will redefine our press. I'm ready for the challenge of doing things a new way.</p>
            <p><strong>How:</strong> Although I finished classes in May of 2014, I will be officially walking and graduating at the end of summer. My internship runs through August 8 at The Gainesville Sun. After that, <strong>I will be relocating to Brooklyn and looking for a challenging, full-time position in the NYC area.</strong></p>
