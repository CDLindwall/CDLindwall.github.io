            <p><strong>Who:</strong> My name is Courtney Lindwall. I'm a 20-year-old, senior journalism student at the University of Florida.</p> 
            <p><strong>What:</strong> I've been working for Gainesville-based Tower Publications the past year, which produces three community magazines. Since starting, I've gained confidence as a reporter juggling deadlines and difficult sources. I've written about everyone from spiritual consultants to elephant trainers to nature photographers. As I attempt to do their stories justice, I keep my writing people-driven. In Spring, I will join the media relations team at UF Health Shands Hospital.</p>
            <p><strong>When:</strong> My relationship with writing started early. As a kid, I was crafting books from construction paper (self-illustrated) and talking about my life as a novelist. But journalism became my focus in high school after working on the school paper and eventually becoming managing editor. My professors and peers at UF have further inspired me to pursue journalism during its next defining era.</p>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Even though everyone seems to have an opinion about the death of traditional journalism, I am looking toward the field's future with optimism. The current generation of professional journalists will redefine our press. I'm ready for the challenge of doing things a new way.</p>
            <p><strong>How:</strong> I'm graduating in May of 2014. I have accepted an internship at The Gainesville Sun that will run from May until July of 2014. After that, <strong>I will be looking for a challenging, full-time position. </strong>I am very open to relocating. Places of interest currently: Seattle, D.C., and Atlanta.</p>
