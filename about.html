            <p>I write. I report. I listen. I tell stories.</p> 
            
            <p>My name is Courtney Lindwall, and I'm a senior journalism student at the University of Florida. Throughout the past few years, everyone imaginable has explained to me why the news industry is dying. From professors to peers to family members, everybody wants to tell me why journalism is a sinking ship.</p>
            
            <p>No more newspapers, they say. People wants news for free, I'm told. What about bloggers, they ask.</p> 
            
            <p>And for a moment, they all seem right. Revenue for traditional journalism outlets is declining. Trust in media is lower than its been in my lifetime. And yes -- news organizations have to do twice as much with half the staff and a quarter of the budget.</p>
            
            <p>But after my years at UF, I've never been more convinced that now is the best time to go into journalism. Now is the time to redefine how news is produced and consumed.</p>
            
            <p>The need to inform, connect, and learn is still strong. The need for stories isn't going anywhere. Through my classes and magazine internship, I'm reaffirmed that the demand for honest, accurate, relevant, and people-driven content is near-universal. This generation of journalists will get to redefine the field. We get to ask: How will the news look now?</p>
            
            <p>That doesn't scare me. It excites me.</p> 
            
            <p>And so, months till graduation, I step sure-footed into a career that may seem shaky to some -- prepared for the ingenuity, energy, and hard work it takes to do something new.</p>
