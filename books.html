            <p>Before my love of newspapers and magazines, I started first with a love simply of words. I wasn't really a writer, but I was a reader.</p>
            <p>Books, the ones that stick, show everything that's possible with language. They show what's possible with creativity, talent, and a knack for storytelling. I believe that if you want to become a writer, there has to be an appreciation of your literary heritage. For that reason, I still read and read often. I believe my own writing (professionally and otherwise) is so intrinsically tied to the books that I've clung to, the authors that have inspired me, and the characters that I've loved. For that reason, I love sharing my own influences.</p>
            <p>"Creative Nonfiction" is my favorite genre. I've always enjoyed it personally, but have also recently taken an interest in it professionally, as well. This style expresses itself in anything from a magazine feature story to the "true crime" classic In Cold Blood to a personal memoir. The blending of reporting and artistic language is powerful. I believe it stays true to way human beings have always shared stories. We don't just give facts. We create narrative arcs and dramatic unveilings, suspenseful cliffhangers and moving finales.</p> 
            <p>Stories have emotion -- creative language gives them life.</p>
            <p>Here are some of my favorite passages from my favorite books:</p>
            <p><strong>"An American Childhood" by Annie Dillard:</strong></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>"The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"</strong> by Junot Diaz</p>
            <p><strong>"The Book of Embraces"</strong> by Eduardo Galeano</p>
            <p><strong>"Middlesex"</strong> by Jeffrey Eugenides</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>"Wild"</strong> by Cheryl Strayed":</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"</strong> by Ken Kesey:</p>
            <p>"We'd just shared the last beer and slung the empty can out the window at a stop sign and were just waiting back to get the feel of the day, swimming in that kind of tasty drowsiness that comes over you after a day of going hard at something you enjoy doing -- half sunburned and half drunk and keeping awake only because you wanted to savor the taste as long as you could."</p>
