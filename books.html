            <p>Before my love of newspapers and magazines, I started first with a love simply of words. I wasn't really a writer then, but I was a reader.</p>
            <p>Books, the ones that stick with you, show everything that's possible with language. They show what's possible with creativity and a knack for storytelling. Writers should appreciate their literary heritage. For that reason, I still read often. I believe my own writing (professionally and otherwise) is so intrinsically tied to the books that I've held onto, the authors that have inspired me, and the characters that I've loved -- so I love sharing my own influences.</p>
            <p>"Creative Nonfiction" is my favorite genre. I've always enjoyed it personally, but have taken an interest in it professionally, as well. This style expresses itself in everything from magazine feature stories to "true crime" classics like In Cold Blood. The blending of reporting and artistic language is powerful. I believe it stays true to way human beings have always shared stories. We don't just give facts. We create narrative arcs and dramatic unveilings, suspenseful cliffhangers and moving finales.</p> 
            <p>Stories have emotion -- creative language gives them life.</p>
            <p>Here are some of my favorite beautiful words from my favorite beautiful books:</p>
            <p><strong>"An American Childhood" by Annie Dillard:</strong></p>
            <p>"Children...wake up and find themselves here, discover themselves to have been here all along; is this sad? They wake like sleepwalkers, in full stride,; they wake like people brought back from cardiac arrest or from drowning: in medias res, surrounded by familiar people and objects, equipped with a hundred skills. They know the neighborhood, they can read and write English, they are old hands at the commonplace mysteries, and yet they feel themselves to have just stepped off the boat, just converged with their bodies, just flown down from a trance, to lodge in an eerily familiar life already well underway."</p>
            <p><strong>"The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"</strong> by Junot Diaz</p>
            <p>“That’s life for you. All the happiness you gather to yourself, it will sweep away like it’s nothing. If you ask me I don’t think there are any such things as curses. I think there is only life. That’s enough.”</p>
            <p><strong>"The Book of Embraces"</strong> by Eduardo Galeano</p>
            <p>"'The world,' he revealed, 'is a heap of people, a sea of tiny flames.'
Each person shines with his or her own light. No two flames are alike. There are big flames and little flames, flames of every colour. Some peoples flames are so still they don't even flicker in the wind, while others have wild flames that fill the air with sparks. Some foolish flames neither burn nor shed light, but others blaze with life so fiercely that you can't look at them without blinking and if you approach, you shine in fire."</p>
            <p><strong>"Wild"</strong> by Cheryl Strayed":</p>
            <p>"How wild it was, to let it be.”</p>
            <p><strong>"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"</strong> by Ken Kesey:</p>
            <p>"We'd just shared the last beer and slung the empty can out the window at a stop sign and were just waiting back to get the feel of the day, swimming in that kind of tasty drowsiness that comes over you after a day of going hard at something you enjoy doing -- half sunburned and half drunk and keeping awake only because you wanted to savor the taste as long as you could."</p>
