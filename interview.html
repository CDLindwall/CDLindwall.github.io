        <p>Local author, journalist, and personal mentor, <strong>Albert Isaac</strong>, sat down with me to discuss his own passion for creative writing. Albert is the editor-in-chief at Gainesville's Tower Publications and has written three books: Endless, Utopia Revisited, and Life So Far.</p>
        <p><strong>When did you get the idea for your first book, Endless?</strong></p>
        <p>It was 1978, and I was 21 when I conceived of the concept behind the book. I wrote the short story in a composition book with a pen, the old-fashioned way. Later I got my hands on a typewriter and typed it up, before the days of word processors. I printed it and gave it to a handful of people - 3 or 4 people might have read it back then. And then I put it in a drawer for 20 years. I went back to it and rewrote it in the early '90s because I had a word processor, and then I put it away until 2004. But all through college I told all my friends, “One day, I'm going to write a book.” </p>
        <p><strong>How'd you get back into working on it?</strong></p>
        <p>When I was discussing that book [Endless] with a friend of mine, he wanted to see it. So I pulled out the old floppies. I had to pull the floppy drive out of the closet, blow the dust out of it. I had to take my computer apart just to read the disk. When I started reading it, I started saying 'Woah, I've gotta fix this.'
I'd email chapters to my friend Phil and then discuss them over some beers downtown.
As a result, I got completely sucked back into that world. </p>
        <p>It wasn't uncommon for me to work until 2 or 3 in the morning and then get up to go to work, because writing wasn't really work. Time flew by because you're creating this world.</p>
        <p><strong>You've had a lot of varied experiences -- a degree in English from UF, a long stint working at the county morgue, and now are in journalism working as an editor. How did those different experiences affect your writing?</strong></p>
        <p>I went to school and got the degree in English, but I also studied journalism, so I had some journalism background. I ended up in the morgue because I needed full-time work and the job became available. It wasn't my life's ambition by any means. Next thing I knew, 20 years went by. During the whole time, I had this creative side I wanted to really use but couldn't use in there. 

            <p>[Endless is a Sci-Fi novel centered around the end of death.] You'd think it’d be odd that someone who works around death all day would write a book about never dying. There was no correlation; it was written before I started that job. I saw the worst of the worst every single day, for six counties in our district. Toward the end, it was really a nice escape to become absorbed in this science-fiction, creative process.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Do you have favorite authors you've tried to emuluate or that you look up to?</strong></p>
            <p>I dont know that I've ever deliberately tried to emulate any particular style. I've been told by friends of mine that the first version of Endless sounded like 1950s science fiction. That makes sense, because I read tons of that as a kid, and it ended up influencing me. To some extent, it still does. 
            <p>Some favorites are Joe Haldeman (he lives here in town), Orson Scott Card, Robert Heinlein, Richard Bach, Arthur Clarke, and William Gibson. </p>
            <p><strong>What advice would you give new writers with aspirations to write books?</strong></p>
            <p>I would tell them to write everyday. I would tell them to not go back and edit it, but to keep writing. I know people who write those first few chapters and then spend the rest of their lives editing those first few chapters. You're not going to write the perfect book the first time.</p>
            <p>I’d be real careful who you get advice from, as far as people critiquing your work. You want to get a lot of opinions. If there are six people telling you something's wrong, it's probably wrong. If you talk to one person, they could really shoot you down -- perhaps unfairly. You really have to believe in yourself. You have to take it with a grain of salt, I guess. There have been really good writers that have somebody shoot them down and then they'll change it or quit.</p>
            <p>And enjoy it, that's really the secret. Enjoying your art.</p>
